# 🌸 Personal Profile Page

## 📖 About the Project
This project was created as part of my front-end development learning journey to demonstrate my ability to design, structure, and style a **personal profile page** using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
It highlights clean design principles, organized layouts, and interactive elements — all with a simple and elegant user experience.
